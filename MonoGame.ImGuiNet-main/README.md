# MonoGame.ImGuiNet

![Monogame.ImGuiNet Logo](Images/ReadMeBanner.png)

**MonoGame.ImGuiNet** is a feature-rich extension of ImGuiNet, enhanced with a set of additional components designed exclusively for MonoGame (Which should work for XNA/FNA as well!). We give full credit to the creators of ImGuiNet for their excellent work.

## Getting Started

- **Installation**: Detailed installation instructions can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/Mezo-hx/MonoGame.ImGuiNet/issues/1).

- **Wiki**: Explore the [Wiki](https://github.com/Mezo-hx/MonoGame.ImGuiNet/wiki) for documentation and guides to get started.

## Notable Mentions

We would like to acknowledge and thank [Dovker](https://github.com/dovker) for the inspiration provided by their original Monogame.imgui project. Their work served as a foundation for our efforts, as the original project was unmaintained.
